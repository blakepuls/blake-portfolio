# Welcome to my Portfolio Website

This website serves as a showcase of my skills and experience. It is built using modern technologies such as Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Prisma, and features a fully functional blog and an admin page.

## Homepage
The homepage serves as an introduction to the website and me as the developer. It includes my profile image, name, title, and a brief introduction. Additionally, the homepage also showcases a list of my skills, each represented by an image icon and the corresponding skill name. At the bottom of the page, you can find a grid of project cards that includes a description, title, technology used, blog link, source link, and an image.

The blog section of the website allows me to share my thoughts and experiences. Each blog post includes a title and a body, which uses React Markdown for formatting.
