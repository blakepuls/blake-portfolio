Let's take a joyride down memory lane and visit the forerunner of Axishop, the Beasts of Bermuda bot. This endeavor involved crafting a comprehensive economy system around the game and offered a fascinating problem that truly put my abilities to the test.

## A Glimpse at the Project

The Beasts of Bermuda bot was architected to blend seamlessly with the game, offering an interactive economy system for the players. The real puzzle, though, stemmed from a particular limitation: Beasts of Bermuda lacked RCON and didn't facilitate sending commands via the server console. This drove me towards a rather unconventional method to execute game commands: crafting a C++ application that seized control of the game to forcefully input all the commands.

## Rising to the Occasion

With a dash of experience in reverse engineering up my sleeve, I was excited to embrace this challenge. The answer was to forge a quasi-RCON via a devoted player on the server.

This dedicated player, fittingly named "Rufus," was stationed on the server, primed to input commands as directed by the bot. In essence, Rufus served as a conduit, receiving commands from the bot and implementing them in the game.

## Rufus: The Unsung Hero of the Community

Beyond the technical implications, Rufus morphed into a community mascot, securing a beloved status among the players. This added an extra dash of engagement and entertainment to the project, transforming it from merely a technical solution into a vibrant part of the game's community.

## Reflecting on the Journey

The Beasts of Bermuda bot project was an exhilarating venture that allowed me to deploy and expand my expertise in reverse engineering. Despite the complexity, devising a workaround for the missing RCON proved to be both enjoyable and fulfilling. It served as a fantastic precursor to the Axishop bot, and the insights gleaned from it have been indispensable in my subsequent endeavors.

As we persist in refining and enhancing projects like Axishop, I'm reminded of the innovative and sometimes unorthodox solutions we've unearthed in the past. It's a testament to the potential of problem-solving in coding, and how welcoming challenges can pave the way for thrilling and unique solutions.
