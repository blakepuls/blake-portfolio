I am excited to share the completion of my latest side project: [MyMediaList](https://mymedialist.blakepuls.dev). This platform streamlines the way multimedia enthusiasts track and rank their favorite TV shows, movies, anime, and books.

## A Personalized Experience

In developing MyMediaList, I aimed to create a platform that acknowledges the excitement of discovering a new series and the anticipation of the next episode or chapter. With MyMediaList, you can add series to your watchlist or readlist and also mark them as 'watching' or 'dropped' to reflect your real-time engagement.

On completing a series, users get the chance to rank it on a scale of 0-10 and place it on a tier list ranging from S to E. This in-depth rating system lets you articulate your opinions vividly and keep track of your all-time favorites.

One key feature I integrated into MyMediaList is the ability to share profiles. This means you can let friends and fellow fans see your lists and rankings, sparking discussions, recommendations, and maybe even a friendly debate or two!

## Behind the Curtain: The Tech Stack

Creating a captivating user experience was a significant goal for MyMediaList, but this project also served as an opportunity to flex my development muscles.

For the backend operations, I utilized Supabase, a powerful tool for managing and ensuring the reliability of data handling. MyMediaList also features a robust user authentication system, developed using Supabase Auth. This system not only prioritizes user data protection but also includes convenient OAuth support.

To enrich the platform with the latest data on shows and movies, I integrated The Movie Database (TMDB) API, allowing users to query rich metadata. Moreover, I made use of Consumet's API for efficient web scraping and series data acquisition.

On the frontend, I built an interactive user interface using dnd-kit, which provides an engaging drag-and-drop system for an intuitive user experience.

## Conclusion

All in all, MyMediaList is a testament to my commitment to develop user-focused, cutting-edge applications. Whether you're a seasoned multimedia enthusiast or just someone looking to keep track of your watchlist, I invite you to try out MyMediaList and redefine your multimedia tracking experience. I'm confident that this platform offers a fresh take on how you track and rank your favorite series, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!
