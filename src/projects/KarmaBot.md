Karma Bot is a multifaceted Discord bot developed for the [Karma Gaming](https://karma-gaming.net/) community, a bustling network of over **8,000 members**. It serves to enhance user engagement across various gaming servers and boasts a wide array of functionalities:

## Log Parsing and Uploading

This feature is dedicated to extracting data from game server logs of CS:GO and Team Fortress 2, and subsequently uploading this to a database for further analysis and review.

## User Verification

Karma Bot is equipped to link a user's Discord account with their in-game accounts, enabling a seamless integration and data tracking across platforms.

## Ticket System

Users can create support tickets directly from Discord. These tickets are then accessible via a web interface, enhancing the customer service experience within the community.

## Moderation System

The bot incorporates message logging and a robust moderation system, facilitating community management with a warning system and various moderation commands.

## Donation Processing

Karma Bot can handle donations, deliver in-game perks to the linked accounts, and send appreciation messages, fostering a supportive community environment.

## Economy System

Mirroring the functionality of [Axishop](https://axishop.gg), Karma Bot introduces an engaging gaming system where users can earn virtual money through games. The earned currency can be used to purchase items from an integrated shop, further enhancing user engagement and interaction.

Through these features, Karma Bot effectively bridges the gap between the Discord platform and the game server, bringing about a cohesive and interactive experience to the Karma Gaming community.
