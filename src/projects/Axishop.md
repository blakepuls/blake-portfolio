Axishop is an innovative Discord bot that introduces an engaging economy and gaming system. Users can interact with the bot to participate in games and earn virtual money. This earned currency can then be used to purchase items from an integrated shop.

The unique selling point of this bot is the ability of these shop items to execute commands on the associated game server. This feature adds an extra layer of interactivity and engagement, bridging the gap between the Discord platform and the game server.
