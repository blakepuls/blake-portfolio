This project is the repository for my portfolio website itself, showcasing a custom animation created with three.js and a sleek, responsive design made possible through Tailwind CSS. The site is built using Next.js, a popular and efficient framework for building React applications. All blog posts and project cards are dynamically generated from .md files, allowing for ease of updates and additions.
