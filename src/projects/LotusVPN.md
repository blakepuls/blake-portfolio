(Made for client)

This project is a VPN application built using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework. The design of the application was chosen by the client and it was built to work in conjunction with SoftEther VPN. The application utilizes lower level functions to interact with the SoftEther VPN software, as it typically requires terminal input. This allows for a more user-friendly interface and streamlined VPN connection experience for the end user. Overall, this project aims to provide a convenient and easy-to-use VPN solution for the client.
