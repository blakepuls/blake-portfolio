MyMediaList is a multimedia tracking platform that allows enthusiasts to easily keep track and rank their favorite TV shows, movies, anime, and books. Users can add series to a watchlist, categorize them as `watching`, `watchlist`, or `dropped`, and even rank them upon completion using a detailed rating system. The platform also includes social features, letting users share their profiles and engage in discussions about their favorite series.

This project was built using a mix of modern technologies, including `Next.js`, `Tailwind CSS`, `React`, and `Supabase`. It allowed me to implement features such as robust backend operations, user authentication with OAuth support, rich metadata querying via APIs, and an interactive user interface with a drag-and-drop system.
